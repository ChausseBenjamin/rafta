# Rafta

**R**eally, **A**nother **F***cking **T**odo **A**pp?!

</div>

## Why?

Most TODO apps suck for power users:

- **In your way**: You have to *go to them*. They don't notify, integrate, or stay out of your workflow.
- **Overkill**: Many try to be wikis, calendars, or even programming platforms.
- **Walled gardens**: APIs locked behind subscriptions or bad docs.
- **Hard to extend**: Monolithic or closed-source.

Rafta flips that:

- A **simple gRPC server** to store and sync tasks.
- A **clean schema** designed for anyone to build clients.
- **No scope creep** — task management, nothing more.
- **Built for hackers** — SQLite backend, no lock-in.

If you want a TODO system that *stays out of your way* and works wherever *you*
work (Neovim, shell, mobile, etc.), take part in the development of rafta.
I promise, I put a lot of thought into it before risking
[creating a new standard][8].

## Dev Setup

- API: gRPC, documented in `resources/schema.proto`
- Auth: [JWT][11] (via Auth endpoint)
- Quickstart: `docker-compose up`
- Client responsibility: All UI, notifications, etc.

    srv--query/update-->db
    db--result-->srv
    srv--response-->client
```

## Client ideas

- **Neovim Plugin**: Like [oil.nvim][10], but for tasks.
- **Mobile App**: Clean UI, simple UX, timely push notifications.
- **[iCal][9] Client**: Generate public/private calendar feeds from task filters.

## Why not existing tools?

- **[Orgmode][1]** / **[TodoTxt][2]** / **[Vimwiki][6]**: Fragile text parsing, sync issues.
- **[Obsidian][3]**: Closed source, poor plugin interop.
- **[Todoist][4]**: Great UX, but API is paywalled.
- **[Apple Reminders][5]**: Locked to macOS/iOS.

Rafta is a **thin server spec** with an open schema. You bring the clients.
